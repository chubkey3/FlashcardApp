# Flashcard Study Tool

## What is this project?

This project is **online flashcard tool** that helps to memorize key terms and definitions for exams. The application will
allow users to create flashcards with one side having the term or question and the other having the definition or answer.
Because of its wide applicability to countless courses or subjects, any student can use this application to help them prepare for
exams or just to review course material. In addition, this application increases the availability of using flashcards to study
as they don't require stationary to be used/bought.

## Why am I making this project?

I created this project because I always heard from friends how useful flashcards can be to study, especially when used in memorization heavy courses,
but I never had the motivation to physically write out
the flashcards. Having it now **digitized** will make it much more accessible to me and others which has the potential to make studying
much easier going forward. Furthermore, all the online flashcard tools I've come across have some paid component so this application
also acts as an open-source alternative to popular paid services such as Quizlet.
